                <h4>Instructions:</h4>
                This site allows you to stitch together multiple similarly sized image files<br />
                into a series of arrays. I wrote it to allow me to easily print cards for a<br/>
                game 4x4 on a page. It may be useful for other things as well.<br/>
                <br/>
                To use: upload the images, set the number of images wide and tall that you want,<br/>
                and then set the zoom level. Click download to download the generated images.<br/>
                <br/>
                If this website is slow you might want to get a faster computer, because I <br/>
                made your computer do all the work.
